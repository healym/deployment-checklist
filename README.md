# The Automated Deployment Checklist

This utility was born of great personal need.
I needed a utility that would allow me to automate checklists in a way that required
no modification of existing deployment infrastructure, so that I could utilize it in
environments with pre-existing structure that others were already comfortable with
(read: the workplace).

While there were many ways of automating checking availible at the time,
I needed a solution that did not require adoption by others, and that could utilize
existing utilities.

This tool allows one to create a checklist, with triggers at each step to run automated
checks or deployment steps. This configuration is done in a JSON file, as shown in the
example below:
